      <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
	containing significant information discovered after the
	release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
	included in the release documentation.  This information
	includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the
	software or documentation that could affect its operation or
	usability.  An up-to-date version of this document should
	always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

      <para>This errata document for &os; &release; will be maintained
	until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking
	news</quote> about &os; &release; Before installing this
      version, it is important to consult this document to learn about
      any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have
      been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
	errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <link
	xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />, plus any
      sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <link

	<para>&os;/&arch.i386; installed on ZFS may crash during boot
	  when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an
	  unmodified <literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel.</para>

	<para>A system tunable has been added as of revision
	  <literal>r286584</literal> to make the
	  <literal>kern.kstack_pages</literal> tunable configurable
	  without recompiling the kernel.</para>

	<para>To mitigate system crashes with such configurations,
	  chose <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the boot
	  menu and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8;
	  prompt, after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<screen>set kern.kstack_pages=4
boot</screen>

	<para>Add this line to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> for the change to
	  persist across reboots:</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>The size of the <acronym>GPT</acronym> enabled
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> boot blocks
	  (<filename>/boot/gptzfsboot</filename>) has increased past
	  82K.  Systems upgraded from older releases may experience
	  a problem where the size of the existing
	  &quot;freebsd-boot&quot; partition is too small to hold the
	  new <filename>gptzfsboot</filename>.</para>

	<para>Systems where the boot partition is immediately followed
	  by the swap partition, such as those installed via
	  &man.bsdinstall.8;, can resize the swap partition slightly
	  using the &man.gpart.8; <literal>resize</literal> command,
	  so space can be reclaimed to increase the size of the
	  freebsd-boot partition.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Due to a bug in earlier versions of &man.clang.1; that
	  is difficult to work around in the upgrade process, to
	  upgrade the system from sources via buildworld to -CURRENT
	  or &release;, it is necessary to upgrade machines running
	  10.x to revision r286033.  Source-based upgrades from
	  10.3-RELEASE are not affected.  This differs from the
	  historical situation where one could generally upgrade from
	  anywhere on earlier stable branches, so caution should be
	  exercised.</para>
